## Title: How to walk alone with God everyday

```markdown
**Psalm 42:1**
1. Know himself
- to know him -> immerse yourself in His Word
Many people say they love God - but more time they spend for your their desires of this world

You need the Holy Spirit to live a life for God

Many people treat prayers like a last response
-> Fixed: the prayer should be the frist response

2) Seperation from Sins
- Sin: seperates us from God and grieves the Holy Spirit of God

3) Perseverence:
- Christian life is the Marathon life

Commit yourself on His Word - rely on His Spirit

=======================
=======================

You cannot walk with God and walk in darkness in the same time for God is Holy
Walking with God is long, difficult and marked by suffering

Walking is not proof in a day but a lifetime


Do you truly seek him or you seek the benefits of his presence?
If you are not immersing yourself in His Word daily - You are deceiving yourself.


You cannot walk with God seperately from the word of God.
Some people taught the word of God as the second prior.

Let allow God's word to penetrate your heart and mind
