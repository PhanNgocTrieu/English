## Why we need to be reminded

### Exodus 6:1-9:
<p>
But the LORD said to Moses,
“Now you shall see what I will do to Pharaoh;
for with a strong hand he will send them out, and with a strong hand he will drive them out of his land.”

2 God spoke to Moses and said to him,
    “I am the LORD.
        3 I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, as God Almighty,
        but by my name the LORD I did not make myself known to them.
        4 I also established my covenant with them to give them the land of Canaan, the land in which they lived as sojourners.
    5 Moreover,
        I have heard the groaning of the people of Israel whom the Egyptians hold as slaves,
        and I have remembered my covenant.

    6 Say therefore to the people of Israel,
        ‘I am the LORD,
        and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians,
        and I will deliver you from slavery to them,
        and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with great acts of judgment.
        7 I will take you to be my people,
        and I will be your God,
            and you shall know that I am the LORD your God, who has brought you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.
        8 I will bring you into the land that I swore to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.
        I will give it to you for a possession.
        I am the LORD.’ ”
9 Moses spoke thus to the people of Israel, but they did not listen to Moses, because of their broken spirit and harsh slavery.

### Why we doubted God?
- for we forget who God is
- for we forget what did he do
